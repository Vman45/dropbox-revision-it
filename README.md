##dropbox-revision-it

dropbox-revision-it invokes the revision/history of files in Dropbox folder.

This script is intended to work as a file manager script. But it should work fine as a command line tool too.

It was tested in a Linux Mint box for the following file managers: Caja, Nautilus, and Thunar.

## Installation

1. Run the script with `--configure` option to configure it.
2. If using Caja or Nautilus, copy the script file to one of the following directories:

        ~/.config/caja/scripts
    
        ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts

   In Thunar, just go to Edit menu, and then configure Custom Actions.

## How to Use

1. Just right-click on any file and run the script.
